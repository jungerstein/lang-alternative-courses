Introductory European Language Courses Using an Alternative Method Serving Researchers. 

Why Bother? 
===========

Of course there are many language courses available now, both in "traditional" textbook form, 
or in multimedia, or even online (the best one, to me, is Duolingo https://www.duolingo.com). 

Yet, these courses mainly serve "general" learners with a background significantly different from us. 
They need different skills from what we do. 
We learn a new language to read scientific textbooks, articles, and / or reports, 
written with educated, complex, entangled structures; 
while they want more to meet quotidian needs. 
Also, the amount of time to learn new languages differs for the two schools of people. 
We are always occupied with and engaged in our research, 
with only fragmented time for studying a new language. 
Since we have a quite good command of English, especially parts inherited from Latin / Greek sources, 
the transferrable skills will accelerate our learning. 
Since we are accustomed to rules and analyses, they will serve much in learning a language, 
at least up to the level of reading.  
Since majority of the "average" learners do not like such a course
(see https://www.duolingo.com/comment/15243844), 
a new course must be drafted.
