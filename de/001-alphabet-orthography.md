# Lesson One The German Alphabet and Orthography (I)

The German Alphabet
===================
1. German is a language using the Latin alphabet. 
It uses all the letters A to Z. 
On A, O, and U, diacritics are also used to form Umlauts
(um = around; Laut = sound, cf. English laud) Ä, Ö, and Ü. 
There is also a ligature ß, combined with a long s 
and a z. 
However, one usually still counts the letters as 26. 
There are no headings Ä, Ö, Ü, or ß in dictionaries or indices. 

1. The letters are called in a manner rather different from in English. 
The differences are introduced when necessary. 

1. In older publications, it is customary to use the Fraktur typeface.

Orthography through Loaned Latin/Greek Words
============================================

Ökonomie
--------

1. At first, see Ökonomie (= Economy). 
All __nouns__ in German should be __captialized__. 
One sees that German does not use a _c on its own_, or a _y_ at the end of a word. 
Instead they are spelled with _k_ (or _z_ for "soft c"), and _ie_ instead.

1. Here one still concentrates on Ökonomie. 
The _o_ sounds o in hot. 
(For precise descriptions, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography. 
Knowledge on IPA is expected. )
The _ie_ is a long i, sounding like ee in bee. 

1. As to the letter Ö, the dots are not a "real" diaresis. 
They are two short slashes above, which is indeed the letter __e__ in Fraktur. 
Hence __Ö__ is pronunced via setting __lips__ as saying __O__, 
but __tongues__ as saying __E__ (somewhat as in bet). 
Cf. Latin oeconomia, Greek οἰκονομια. 

1. Since the word is feminine in Latin and Greek, it is still so in German. 
German has also three genders, __masculine__ (m), __feminine__ (f), and __neuter__ (n). 

1. Feminine nouns take the article __die__ in their "dictionary" form 
(technically singular nominative, discussed later in the course). 
The ending _ie_ is the same as in __Ökonomie__. 
The letter _d_ can be compared with the English _th_ in "the". 
German lacks the both th sound. 
This phonetic difference may be familiar: this --- X dis, that --- X dat.
