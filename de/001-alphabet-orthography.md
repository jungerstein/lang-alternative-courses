# Lesson One The German Alphabet and Orthography (I)

The German Alphabet
===================
1. German is a language using the Latin alphabet. 
It uses all the letters A to Z. 
On A, O, and U, diacritics are also used to form Umlauts
(um = around; Laut = sound, cf. English laud) Ä, Ö, and Ü. 
There is also a ligature ß, combined with a long s 
and a z. 
However, one usually still counts the letters as 26. 
There are no headings Ä, Ö, Ü, or ß in dictionaries or indices. 

1. The letters are called in a manner rather different from in English. 
The differences are introduced when necessary. 

1. In older publications, it is customary to use the Fraktur typeface.

Orthography through Loaned Latin/Greek Words
============================================
1. At first, see Ökonomie (= Economy). 
All __nouns__ in German should be __captialized__. 
One sees that German does not use a _single c_, or a _y_ at the end of a word. 
Instead they are spelled with _k_ (or _z_ for "soft c"), and _ie_ instead.
