# Lesson One The German Alphabet and Orthography (I)

The German Alphabet
===================
1. German is a language using the Latin alphabet. 
It uses all the letters A to Z. 
On A, O, and U, diacritics are also used to form Umlauts
(um = around; Laut = sound, cf. English loud) Ä, Ö, and Ü. 
There is also a ligature ß, combined with a long s 
and a z. 
However, one usually still counts the letters as 26. 
There are no headings Ä, Ö, Ü, or ß in dictionaries or indices. 

1. The letters are called in a manner rather different from in English. 
The differences are introduced when necessary. 

1. In older publications, it is customary to use the Fraktur typeface.

Orthography through Loaned Latin/Greek Words
============================================

Ökonomie
--------

1. At first, see Ökonomie (= Economy). 
All __nouns__ in German should be __captialized__. 
One sees that German does not use a _c on its own_, or a _y_ at the end of a word. 
Instead they are spelled with _k_ (or _z_ for "soft c"), and _ie_ instead.

1. Here one still concentrates on Ökonomie. 
The _o_ sounds o in hot. 
(For precise descriptions, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography. 
Knowledge on IPA is expected. )
The _ie_ is a long i, sounding like ee in bee. 

1. As to the letter Ö, the dots are not a "real" diaresis. 
They are two short slashes above, which is indeed the letter __e__ in Fraktur. 
Hence __Ö__ is pronunced via setting __lips__ as saying __O__, 
but __tongues__ as saying __E__ (somewhat as in bet). 
Cf. Latin oeconomia, Greek οἰκονομια. 

1. Since the word is feminine in Latin and Greek, it is still so in German. 
German has also three genders, __masculine__ (m), __feminine__ (f), and __neuter__ (n). 

1. Feminine nouns take the article __die__ in their "dictionary" form 
(technically singular nominative, discussed later in the course). 
The ending _ie_ is the same as in __Ökonomie__. 
The letter _d_ can be compared with the English _th_ in "the". 
German lacks the both th sound. 
This phonetic difference may be familiar: this --- X dis, that --- X dat.

Technologie
-----------

1. More than an answer to a controlling quiz, this is a real German word. 
(Skip the contents in the parentheses if you wish. 
Technologie is what one gets when one applies our research, 
or in the sense "the technology to solve cubic equations". 
The wider "technology" is Technik. )

1. Here, the ch reads [x]. Yes, it is the correct pronunciation of X in TeX. 

1. In German, there is nothing like soft g. 
All __g__ should be read __"hard"__, as the g in gas. 

1. The e in Tech is rendered as the English e in bed. 
The German e is never rendered as in English see; that would be an German i. 

1. Controlling quiz: do you know what a Gymnasium is? 

Gymnasium
---------

1. In English, you go to gymnasium to exercise your _body_. 
In German, your child go to a Gymnasium to exercise his/her _mind_. 
The German version of Gymnasium refers to a grammar school. 

1. As you may know, the word is loaned from Latin gymnasium, 
Greek γυμνάσιον. The verb is γυμνάζω "to exercise". 

1. The German __s__ on its own at syllable beginnings reads like English __z__. 
The greek Z in the verb helps to memorize it. 

1. The German __y__ on its own reads the same way as Ü, 
i.e. __u__ in lips, __e__ at tounge. 

1. Of course it is of the __neuter__ gender as it is in Latin, 
the same as many -ium in the Periodic Table of Elements. 

1. The German u sounds like oo in book. 

1. The German a sounds like a in bar (in British fashion). 

1. The article is __das__. The __as__ is familiar (contained in Gymn<b>as</b>ium).
