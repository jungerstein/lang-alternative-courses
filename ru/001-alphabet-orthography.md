# Lesson One The Russian Alphabet and Orthography (I)

The Russian Alphabet
====================

1. Russian uses Cyrillic letters. 
   It shares the same sources with the Latin letters, 
     so they are not too hard to learn. 

1. Russian cursives are very interesting. 
   They differ from printing fonts in an extend far greater than Latin letters do.

1. That word represents the name of a month. 

1. Perhaps You have already guessed right. 

1. The letters. 

   1. The letter __А а__ can be treated as its Latin counterpart, making the _ah_ sound. 
      That is our alpha (though its Russian name is the _ah_ itself). 

   1. The letter __В в__ is the counterpart of _V v_, **not _B b_**. 
      These letters transcribe Latin _au_. 
      That is our beta (but still not the Russian name).

   1. The letter __Г г__ corresponds to _G g_, but the _g_ is __hard__. 
      That is our gamma (but not the Russian name). 
      We have no problem understanding and remembering the letter. 

   1. The letter __У у__ corresponds to _U u_. It is a bit harder.
